# Features/Ideas
Insert any ideas or features you would like to see implemented in the Linux Society compositor/window manager.

- Having a proper programming language like Python, Haskell, C, or Rust for configuration
  - Likely consider using lua, which is easy to embed and is used commonly as a config language
- Customisable keybinds
  - User macros for things like running shell commands
  - Optional includable keybind presets (i.e. hyprland-like, windows-like, etc)
  - Scratchpads: Bind a certain window (e.g. a terminal) to a keybind that toggles its visibility. Useful for windows that you use frequently but only briefly each time. As far as I know, dwm, XMonad, and QTile has this 
    feature, and you can use Pyprland to get this feature on Hyprland.
- Tiling window management
- Winit and Udev (for tty) as supported backends.
