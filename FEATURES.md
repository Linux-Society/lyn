# Features/Ideas
Insert any ideas or features you would like to see implemented in the Linux Society compositor/window manager.

- Scratchpads: Bind a certain window (e.g. a terminal) to a keybind that toggles its visibility. Useful for windows that you use frequently but only briefly each time. As far as I know, dwm, XMonad, and QTile has this feature, and you can use Pyprland to get this feature on Hyprland.
- Having a proper programming language like Python, Haskell, C, or Rust for configuration
